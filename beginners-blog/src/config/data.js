      "While AI and automation technologies have the potential to streamline certain aspects of software testing, it is unlikely that ChatGPT or similar AI models will completely replace software testers. Software testing involves a wide range of activities, including designing test cases, identifying bugs, performing exploratory testing, analyzing test results, and ensuring the overall quality of software applications. These tasks often require human creativity, critical thinking, and domain knowledge that may be challenging for AI models to fully replicate.",

      "AI can assist and enhance the software testing process by automating repetitive tasks, such as regression testing or generating test data. AI models can also be used for code analysis, anomaly detection, or test case prioritization. However, human testers play a crucial role in defining test strategies, understanding user perspectives, providing contextual insights, and conducting exploratory testing, which requires intuition and adaptability. Instead of replacing software testers, AI technologies are more likely to augment their capabilities and improve overall efficiency. Software testers can leverage AI tools to focus on higher-value tasks, such as test planning, test case design, risk analysis, and user experience evaluation.",

      "It's important to recognize that while AI can be a valuable tool in software testing, human testers bring unique skills and expertise that are difficult to replicate. Collaboration between humans and AI technologies is often the most effective approach to ensure comprehensive and high-quality software testing.",

        for me with no luck, jest was not able to run the import axios code from the file, after googling a found the solution which was
        to edit the code in my jest.config.js and add the code below. after that everything went as expected the tests ran successfully!`,

        so much time googling stuff so to have someone to help you with your exact issue is awesome, of course in more complex tests it would not be able to do it for you.
        we'll see how things will pan out in the future, for now lets focus on using ChatGPT to our advantage.`,
